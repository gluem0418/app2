Somewhere not of this world, on the "Continent of Alphonse".

Long ago,
there were seven demon kings who plunged the world into chaos.
They were sealed away in the sky by humans and transcendents.

Now they are known as the "Seven Demon Moons", 
and whenever you look up at the night sky, 
you will always see the Seven Demon Moons shining somewhere.

A few years ago,
two moons suddenly rose in the night sky at the same time.
Since then, monsters have become violent,
and rumors have spread among the people that the Seven Demon Kings 
will be resurrected if all the "Seven Demon Moons" rise.

The king, who took the situation seriously, ordered, 
"Go to that place and solidify the seal."
Many soldiers and adventurers headed to the sealed place, 
but none succeeded.

Finally, 
on a night when four moons rose in the night sky,
one adventurer visited the "City of Viego"...
